# Tires; 

As mentioned, the most important part of any vehicle are its tires. After all, they are solely responsible for all actions to do with accelerating, braking, and cornering. 

They are sometimes modeled simplistically, but in reality we know that the forces they can provide relies on more than one factor. 

## Tire Parameters; Vertical Load 

Our rigid body understanding of friction is as follows; 

$F_{fr} = F_N\cdot \mu$ 
* $F_{fr}=$ Frictional Force
* $F_N=$ Vertical Load (Normal Force)
* $\mu=$ Coefficient of Friction

These seem relatively straightforward, but there are various important parameters to keep in mind. They all have to do with the coefficient of friction

### A) Frictional Coefficient is Directional

The frictional coefficient changes based on the direction force is applied. This is why the traction circle is important; lateral loads and longitudinal loads *will* differ

### B) Coefficient of Friction varies based on the Vertical Load

The rate at which frictional force increases is decreasing by vertical load. 

This is because tires are load sensitive. As the vertical load is increased, the coefficient decreases. However, the overall result is still an increase of frictional force, but a lower one than a constant coefficient.
