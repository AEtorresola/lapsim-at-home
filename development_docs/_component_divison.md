Contains all vehicle parameters. These include:

self.mass = mass
self.wheelbase = wheelbase
self.cg_position = cg_height
self.track_width = track_width
self.tire_radius = tire_radius
self.drag_coeff = drag_coeff
self.downforce_coeff = downforce_coeff
self.frontal_area = frontal_area
self.rolling_resistance = rolling_resistance
self.tire_grip = tire_grip
self.engine_characteristics = engine_characteristics
self.gear_ratio = gear_ratio
self.drivetrain_efficiency = drivetrain_efficiency
self.braking_force_distribution = braking_force_distribution

* mass 
  * total mass of the vehicle 
* wheelbase 
  * length of wheelbase (m)
* cg_position
  * coordinates of center of gravity. assume middle of rear wheels as origin 
  * positive x is longitude (back to front)
  * positive y is lateral (center to right)
  * negative y is lateral (center to left)
